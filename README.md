WhatToDoCMU is a project for TartanHacks2020 by Ela Gulsen and Justin Zhang.
The purpose of the project is to allow students to view events on campus and connect with clubs they're interested in.
By clicking on the calendar tab, you'll be able to see upcoming events on campus.
Want to branch out and make new friends but not sure what you're interested in?
Fill out a survey on the recommendations page and we'll connect you with clubs we think you may be interested in.
